# Pandas Practice Files

This repository contains a comprehensive set of practice exercises designed to enhance your skills and understanding of **pandas**, the powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. The exercises are divided into two parts, focusing on both fundamental and advanced pandas operations using real-world datasets.

## Contents

### Part 1: General Practice (Exercises 1–34)

- Exercises are based on randomly generated dictionaries and sets.
- Covers core pandas functionalities such as:
  - Creating and manipulating DataFrames
  - Handling rows and columns
  - Applying basic statistical functions
  - Data filtering and selection
- **Purpose:** Build a strong foundation in pandas and become familiar with essential operations.

### Part 2: Working with Excel Sheets (Exercises 35–89)

- Exercises utilize two datasets:
  - **Grades_Short.xlsx**: Student grades dataset, focusing on:
    - Numerical and categorical data processing
    - Filtering, grouping, and aggregating
    - Computing averages, totals, and summary statistics
  - **Missing_values.xlsx**: Dataset emphasizing missing data handling:
    - Identifying and managing null/missing values
    - Filling, replacing, or dropping missing data
    - Ensuring data integrity for accurate analysis

## Included Files
